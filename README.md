This is targeted to be a game made from scratch. At the moment the Project is paused because of study and carrer reasons

The main target is to build a game without external Librarys except the hardware Api's like Vulkan or OpenGL/OpenCl. 

purpos: 
Learning more about graphical development.
Achieve deeper knowledge of game engines and game development.

external Librarys for now:
GLFW and GLAD (Maybe keeping them)
